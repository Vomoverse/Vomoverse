Purpose of Presale and Airdrop smart contract:

1. Presale Contract is contract for purpose of selling Token to public. Here buyToken is on Timestamp basis which means buyer can not buy Token after given Timestamp. By default 
we set 1 ether for 100 token means buyer can buy 100 token at 1 ether accordingly. 

2. An airdrop[1] is an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses. Airdrops are often associated with the launch of a new cryptocurrency primarily as a way of 
gaining attention and new followers, resulting in a larger user base and a wider disbursement of coins.
in this number of Token in configurable( means admin can set how many token can sent on each airdrop)

Remix-Solidity

Remix is a suite of tools that helps smart contract development, compilation, testing & deployment. These tools also works as a 
core of native plugins of Remix IDE.

Remix IDE is an IDE for Solidity dApp developers, powered by Remix. The Remix IDE repository is available here, and an online version is
available at https://remix.ethereum.org.

For more, check out the Remix IDE documentation.

Contracts:
1. Airdrop.sol
2. Token.sol


Deploy the Smart Contracts using remix ide and inject web3 for following steps:

Write a smart contract for Airdrop and Presale  Functionality:

The Presale tokens are based on the StandardToken and MintableToken ERC20 contracts.

1 . First we compile the smart contract using compiler version on remix ide.
2.  Deploy the smart contract using remix ide and choose deploy on local host or testnet:

Local host :
Javascript Berlin
Javascript London

Testnet:
For testnet we choose inject web3 . Inject web3 connect on our metamask wallet.
after that we deploy the smart contract on testnet.
